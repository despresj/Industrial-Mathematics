```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

in the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r results='asis'}
library(kableExtra)

a <- tibble::tribble(
      ~Variable,         ~Type,                                          ~Description,
  "is_canceled", "Categorical", "Indicates if the reservation cancels their booking."
  )

kbl(a, booktabs = T) %>%
kable_styling("striped", full_width = F)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
